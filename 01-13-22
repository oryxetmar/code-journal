01-13-21 Journal Entry
I am behind on journal entries and honestly feel like ive no idea whats happening- I am still very much trying to figure out the command line
running into problems when i try to add the .html into my code-journal repo
i found a few youtube videos so i am hopeful at the lunch break that i can follow those along and try again- its due tonight soooo
- i did start my figma account and i want to be ready to "pass code" as a fun game like discussed this morning in class but I am so not ready for that activity
i need to figure out how to have this saved and then uplaoded to brightspace so i am not losing marks here
