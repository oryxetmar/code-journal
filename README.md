### customizing journal entries
- woke up early and decided to google custimizations to github fonts
- struggled yesterday to set up a theme , still dont think i did it right at all. 
- in ##assignment1 i think screwed up by adding branches because Tony only has his main brain under code-journal within the link he shared
### biggest question:
-i need to know what the order is for git to vscode/terminal
- https://www.atlassian.com/git/glossary
- here is the sequence
    1. make a change
    2. save the file
    3. go to the terminal
    4. ` git add . `
    5. ` git commit -m "message here" `
    6.  ` git push `

## it is very early lol or very late 
### i just tried to create a `merge conflict` 
- i cloned the repo that erik made
- i made changes to the file in my vscode
- i saved changes to my computer (is this called local or staging area)
- i used my terminal to `git add .` `git push` `git status`
- received *everything up-to-date* as feedback
- `git status` listed up to date with `origin/main`
- (use "git restore --staged <file>..." to unstage)
        modified:   README.txt
        I dont know if ive created a conflict
        but I didnt `commit to -m`  soooo im hoping i did it

## markdown journal for assignment

1.) I want to be coding for one hour a day
    - i need to learn so much more about this lol
---

2.) I want to be a day ahead of the Prep at all times so that i feel less overwhelmed
---

3.) I want to have several more coding phrases memorized
    - it is so cool to me that coders use tons and tons of phrases but not necessarily the same ones all the time to get the same actions done
---

4.) My Performance:
    - I am so brand new to everyhting here that my performance is going to be based a bit behind where I would ideally like to be
    - i want daily github activity
    - i want as many labs as possible completed either during labtime or on  weekends/evenings
    - i am currently shocked that i seem to be understanding most things at this point (do not want to speak too soon sos)
    - i need to be more on top of all the extra things mentioned in class time 
        ie.) the apps mentioned, programs people use, being faster with my terminal terms
--- 

### today's wins :
- I am not feeling like there are a lot right now
- I have some health things that come up and make it very difficult to be in front of a screen when pain isnt managed, so today is a rough one
- i will have this journal entry submitted right away
- and i will have the UX assignment done if not almost done so that I know exactly what I need help with in tmr tutorial time

### proof of work

- i am going to take a pause from this journal entry for today and move to the assignment so that i can better journal about my **steps taken** 
## brb

### daily work update
**static website from command line to GitHub**
- i think i did it! link below:
https://github.com/oryxetmar/template-exercise

- it took my quite awhile to figure out how to downlad a template, honestly. which i dont even think was suppsoed to be difficult
- this website was a help: https://towardsdatascience.com/building-a-beautiful-static-webpage-using-github-f0f92c6e1f02
    - and i found my template here : https://html5up.net/

**confession** i dont understand where to see the actual website that guthub is creating through these repos

I realize I am excessively journaling here but i need to understand **gists** now and i am a bit confused about what they are

# so cool
## things i just remembered on my own:
### i ran into the same problem as the first time i tried pushing to git after additions from VSCode code-journal to my github -
**you have to save in VSCode before adding and committing and then pushing**
    - i realize this seems basic but i solved the problem so quikcly this time on my own sooooo
### daily wins:
    - solving code errors (even if the most basic) - nailed it.
