### customizing journal entries
- woke up early and decided to google custimizations to github fonts
- struggled yesterday to set up a theme , still dont think i did it right at all. 
- in ##assignment1 i think screwed up by adding branches because Tony only has his main brain under code-journal within the link he shared
### biggest question:
-i need to know what the order is for git to vscode/terminal
- https://www.atlassian.com/git/glossary
- here is the sequence
    1. make a change
    2. save the file
    3. go to the terminal
    4. ` git add . `
    5. ` git commit -m "message here" `
    6.  ` git push `

# 01-15-22
## it is very early lol or very late 
### i just tried to create a `merge conflict` 
- i cloned the repo that erik made
- i made changes to the file in my vscode
- i saved changes to my computer (is this called local or staging area)
- i used my terminal to `git add .` `git push` `git status`
- received *everything up-to-date* as feedback
- `git status` listed up to date with `origin/main`
- (use "git restore --staged <file>..." to unstage)
        modified:   README.txt
        I dont know if ive created a conflict
        but I didnt `commit to -m`  soooo im hoping i did it

# 01-17-22
## websites i want to work through tonight
- https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/saving-changes/git-commit
    -  https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/using-branches/git-merge
    -    https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/addressing-merge-conflicts/resolving-a-merge-conflict-on-github

 ### Watch whole lecture back and follow along

 ### to-do:
 - edit images, suss apps/websites recommended and pick fav?
 - do assignment

### submit merge conflict asssignment
- how do i link to lines in the README to show my specific conflicts and resolutions

# 01-18-22
## markdown journal for assignment

1. I want to be coding for one hour a day
    - i need to learn so much more about this lol

2. I want to be a day ahead of the Prep at all times so that i feel less overwhelmed

3. I want to have several more coding phrases memorized
    - it is so cool to me that coders use tons and tons of phrases but not necessarily the same ones all the time to get the same actions done

4. My Performance:
    - I am so brand new to everyhting here that my performance is going to be based a bit behind where I would ideally like to be
    - i want daily github activity
    - i want as many labs as possible completed either during labtime or on  weekends/evenings
    - i am currently shocked that i seem to be understanding most things at this point (do not want to speak too soon sos)
    - i need to be more on top of all the extra things mentioned in class time 
        ie.) the apps mentioned, programs people use, being faster with my terminal terms
--- 

### today's wins :
- I am not feeling like there are a lot right now
- I have some health things that come up and make it very difficult to be in front of a screen when pain isnt managed, so today is a rough one
- i will have this journal entry submitted right away
- and i will have the UX assignment done if not almost done so that I know exactly what I need help with in tmr tutorial time

### proof of work

- i am going to take a pause from this journal entry for today and move to the assignment so that i can better journal about my **steps taken** 
## brb

### daily work update
**static website from command line to GitHub**
- i think i did it! link below:
https://github.com/oryxetmar/template-exercise

- it took my quite awhile to figure out how to downlad a template, honestly. which i dont even think was suppsoed to be difficult
- this website was a help: https://towardsdatascience.com/building-a-beautiful-static-webpage-using-github-f0f92c6e1f02
    - and i found my template here : https://html5up.net/

**confession** i dont understand where to see the actual website that guthub is creating through these repos

I realize I am excessively journaling here but i need to understand **gists** now and i am a bit confused about what they are

# so cool
## things i just remembered on my own:
### i ran into the same problem as the first time i tried pushing to git after additions from VSCode code-journal to my github -
**you have to save in VSCode before adding and committing and then pushing**
    - i realize this seems basic but i solved the problem so quikcly this time on my own sooooo
### daily wins:
    - solving code errors (even if the most basic) - nailed it.

- shift + control + 4 = screen cap
- cassie codes - design blog details/Ashlyn showing us her blog design

## pulling up dev mode

- To open the developer console in Google Chrome, open the Chrome Menu in the upper-right-hand corner of the browser window and select More Tools > Developer Tools. You can also use Option + âŒ˜ + J (on macOS), or Shift + CTRL + J (on Windows/Linux).

**must use firefox to open dev tools**
    - had to set all acount in firefox with memorized passwords, took a hot minute

# 01-21-22
## Responsive Web Design
- flexbox is confusing the hell out of me
- i feel like i blinked and now im confused. I thought i understood it but now i cant seem to get a flexbox going with the .css styles?
- i did my wiki article and that made sense mostly

### struggles
- how the heck are images being controlled properly and why wont my text centre? I honestly dont understand.
- i understand colors and for the most part i understand text
- html isnt an issue but i am struggling hard with css, have like 40 tabs iopen just trying to figure out what on earth im doing wrong

*most important ; i feel like im behind*
- complete and hand in navigation assignment
- go through classes on html, css and flex box **wtf is happening here**
- why do the git repos that i forked have `styles.css` files attached ?

## Wiki Article + Figma
- as a small win, i understand how to get figma images into my codepen files
- as a massive loss, i am struggling with css details and how expansive they can be

## css styles + images + colors
- i am putting tgthr a folder with my favs or design assets that may be useful in the future
- here is an attched link for the work ive been doing with figma
https://www.figma.com/files/drafts?fuid=1063491473920432983

https://codepen.io/pen/

- i need definite help with this one so i can understand the assignment due on Wednesday 26th

## wednesday due date for first assignment - sos


    - enitre box is a body tag - do not need to tag, it is the whole box
    - main tag doesnt need to exist - if your website has a primary section <main> is a good wrapper
    - <header> needed, <footer> needed
    - <nav> <href=>

### Little wins for today!!
- i cannot tell you how long i worked from this morning until 7:22pm to understand WHY ON EARTH my nave bar wouldnt properly row my links. so my solving this issue on my own is very big news.
### DISPLAY: FLEX;
- the above command needs to be listed under the specified container in order for flexbox commands to be applied. *insert crying face, like sobbing face*

I have to be gone for all of class tmr and I am so panicked about it. This means I NEEDED to properly catch up and understand flexbox and .css TODAY.
I want my assignment 260-a1 done this evening. 

Here is a link to my current progress and honestly it is not much. But it is a massive win for me :)

Being able to solve any small bug issues or terminal issues feels massive to me.

## Work Accomplished For Today

- font awesome and line awesome installed
- i learned how to put these into the <head> of my codepens
- nav bar!! I finally figured this out and am working on the main content of assignment one
- i realized that code journals were due last week and this week when i thought they were not until march (i didnt realzie birghtspace had a place for code jounral in 260 and not just course 270, thats a hard mybad)
- i am still struggling a bit i think to understand github pages
- they were simple until i attempted to add a .css style to my code journal and now i cant seem to pull up the live page anymore.

# 3am 01-26-22
### i will write a proper entry about the full cpnt260-a1 assignment in the am

- Reflection:
- i spent at least 3-4 hours trying to figure out how to centre align text. i am not kidding. i was very shaky with flexbox and i wasnt understanding the process very well. around 7:30pm yesterday i made a discovery!! 
- display: flex;  - this is necessary IT IS V NECESSARY
- i used the dev tools to correct bugs and that was so helpful as well, just to understand what was preventing movements or additions when i felt confused about what wasnt working like i wanted it to
## Further Reflections
- so i had a lot to learn in regards to linking the css.styles and stylesheets
- its taken me about 3 hours honestly to try and figure out what ive done wrong. BUT GOOD NEWS; it looks like a simple issue of not having enough code added into the html:5 head
- as well as I had a /css.style and that needed to be correcting in the link line to appropriate name for my link which was css.style ... awesome lol
- i am getting very good at solving my issues on my own but i am NOT FAST AT IT HOLY HECK
 ## current issue
 - i cannot quite understand why my coffee mug logo with the hover effect wont appear on my github page but my fontawesome link is attached properly i believe (altho obvi not)
 ### FIXED
 - well it is 3am, but i do believe i have it fixed!! my hovering coffee logo is appearing properly now. 
 - i know there are double of my index and css files but i am terrified to delete anything at this point. they should be identical
- if zipping my file destroys everything... RIP

Thanks for coming to my Ted Talk on Coding for Dumbies 101

# 01-30-22
## coding daily goals
- i have been trying hard to make sure i am pushing through updates and all assignments or projects to github, i want as much green as possible on the little chart 
- its been solid practice to make sure my `css.styles` and `stylesheets` properly sync up when made into github pages

## issues
- im having issues with the breakpoints so today i am trying to focus on figuring that out
- this last week had me feeling a bit disappointed in how behind i was (always like a day or two)
- I have some health stuff that can really get in the way of following lectures or studying when a round of nausea strikes and this week was a rough go so i felt like i wasnt able to follow along as well as i needed to

### to access fontawesome icons 

<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/font-awesome/5.15.2/css/all.min.css">

- You can also download the icons and store them in your assets
- set icons with <i> tag

## my ABOUT/HOME GIT PAGE
https://oryxetmar.github.io/home-about-page/

### Reflection on assign 2
- setting up the interactive navbar was the biggest thing to learn here
- trying to set up a drop down menu that was invisibile and then visible and hovered with transparent background took me awhile (i could not figure it out last night and was so frustrated so i need to wake up and do it today)
- its actually super cool to see how much ive learned tho in such a sort window: links, linking pages in the nav bar, colums, hovering etc

# 02-01-22

## Form Page
- there is a lot to unpack here
- im confused about *radio* buttons-
    - are they supposed to be in some way.. responsive differently than *text* ?
    - why so many different tags ... with similar or identical titles : ie <label for="time-to-call" class="input-title">Best Time to Call</label>
        <input type="time-to-call"name="time-to-call" id="time-to-call"placeholder="required"> 

## Questions for Ashlyn
- i am confused about gists vs repo
- hackmd vs github vs  codepen vs vscode
- if i am writing my html through vscode; is it showing up in a github pages as i edit?
- notes/journal entries : hackmd or readme for github ?
### Re Radio Buttons

- in a group of radio buttons you can only select one
- in check boxes oyu can select many

### ID Class 
- override a class by using ID
- one class gets only one ID

 ## CCS Tricks

 - `border-radius: 15px 50px 30px 5px;` or `border-radius: 50px 50px 50px 50px;` i liked that better
 - ` box-shadow: 0 20px 20px #70400f;`
