### customizing journal entries
- woke up early and decided to google custimizations to github fonts
- struggled yesterday to set up a theme , still dont think i did it right at all. 
- in ##assignment1 i think screwed up by adding branches because Tony only has his main brain under code-journal within the link he shared
### biggest question:
-i need to know what the order is for git to vscode/terminal
- https://www.atlassian.com/git/glossary
- here is the sequence
    1. make a change
    2. save the file
    3. go to the terminal
    4. ` git add . `
    5. ` git commit -m "message here" `
    6.  ` git push `
