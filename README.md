### customizing journal entries
- woke up early and decided to google custimizations to github fonts
- struggled yesterday to set up a theme , still dont think i did it right at all. 
- in ##assignment1 i think screwed up by adding branches because Tony only has his main brain under code-journal within the link he shared
### biggest question:
-i need to know what the order is for git to vscode/terminal
- https://www.atlassian.com/git/glossary
- here is the sequence
    1. make a change
    2. save the file
    3. go to the terminal
    4. ` git add . `
    5. ` git commit -m "message here" `
    6.  ` git push `

## it is very early lol or very late 
### i just tried to create a `merge conflict` 
- i cloned the repo that erik made
- i made changes to the file in my vscode
- i saved changes to my computer (is this called local or staging area)
- i used my terminal to `git add .` `git push` `git status`
- received *everything up-to-date* as feedback
- `git status` listed up to date with `origin/main`
- (use "git restore --staged <file>..." to unstage)
        modified:   README.txt
        I dont know if ive created a conflict
        but I didnt `commit to -m`  soooo im hoping i did it
